# Impacts on Society

Course: AP Computer Science Principles (CSP)
Grade Level: 10–12

The course I plan to teach is AP Computer Science Principles (AP CSP). This course introduces students to the foundational concepts of computer science, including problem-solving, programming, algorithms, data, the internet, and the global impact of computing. Students also develop skills in abstraction, collaboration, creativity, and communication.

This plan outlines how I will integrate lessons and discussions about the impacts of computing on society throughout the course. By including these topics, students will learn to evaluate both the benefits and harms of technology, preparing them to make thoughtful, ethical contributions to the digital world.

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

Aligned with Bloom’s Taxonomy, the learning objectives for the social impacts portion of the course are:

Remember/Understand: Define key terms related to computing impacts.

Analyze: Examine case studies of computing technologies and identify potential positive and negative consequences.

Evaluate: Critically evaluate the ethics of new technologies and explain and understand different stakeholder perspectives.

Create: Propose solutions or guidelines for addressing societal challenges caused by computing.

Affective Objective: Develop an appreciation for the diverse ways computing affects people and foster empathy for populations disproportionately impacted by technology.

### Learning Activities

To achieve these objectives, the following activities will be incorporated:

Class Discussions: Weekly discussions on current events in computing, using news articles.

Case Study Reviews: Small-group projects analyzing current challenges such as facial recognition, self-driving vehicles, and social media misinformation.

Written Reflections: Short essays and reflections about current challenges in technology use.

Debates: Structured debates on computing topics.

Final Project Component: Using skills learned while programming and coding, students will reflect on the potential societal impact of their project and present it in their preferred programming language.

These activities will occur both as one-time lessons (e.g., debates) and ongoing activities (e.g., weekly news discussions).

### Assessment

Student understanding will be assessed through:

Formative Assessments: Participation in discussions, submission of reflections, and participation during group project contributions.

Summative Assessments: Case study presentations graded with a rubric focussed on analysis and evaluation skills.

Written essays evaluated with a rubric focussed on analysis and evaluation skills.

Effectiveness of lessons will be monitored through performance. Lessons will be revised based on any gaps in understanding concepts and their societal impacts.

### Outcomes

This plan supports diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) by:

Broadening Participation: Providing examples of computing impacts on underrepresented groups.

Promoting Equity in Learning: Using group work and multiple assessment formats to allow students with different strengths and backgrounds to succeed.

This approach will prepare students to think critically about computing’s role in society and teach them the importance of responsible technology use.
